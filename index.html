              <h3>User Persona's</h3>
              <p>The creation of our User Personas 'Mike' and 'Tim' allowed our group to identitfy our core target user groups; Landlords and Tennants.
                During our research process these personas were key to understanding the possible problems and solutions for this platform, and were exceptionally important creating and understanding the user journeys for our user groups.

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>Our group conducted our user testing and research over a one week period. Due to this time constraint, we were only able to interview four individuals; three tennants, and one landlord.
            While our interviews were completed individually, our group was able to create a structured interview plan to insure a fair and consistent interview process.</p>

          <p>overview</p>
            <h5>Analysis of Interviews</h5>
          <p>Using the information gathered during our user testing, our group identitified three core findings from both landlord and tennant user groups.</p>
              <h6>Landlords</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Prioritise simple and open communication between the tenant, landlord, and other involved individuals.</li>
            <li>Control over the tenant selection process to insure an appropriate fit for the properties.</li>
            <li>Focused on streamlining the day-to-day administration and maintenance issues then large occasional task; such as finding new tenants.</li>
          </ul>
            <h6>Tennants</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Tenants become largely frustrated over the competitive rental market, this feeling peaks during January and February.</li>
            <li>Security and trust is a core issue for a tenant when renting, both with property management and property marketplaces.</li>

          <h3>Prototypes</h3>
            <p> After analysing the information we gathered from the competitor analysis and user interviews, we identified four key areas to create and improve upon. These areas were; Landlord Onbaording, Tennant Verification, Tennant Application, and Watchlist management which we divided the tasks amongst ourselves.
              As a group we decided that the best approach to this process was to focus on prototyping for a responsive mobile application.
            We primarily worked on this aspect independently with the occasional comment and help from our team members. </p>
          <h5>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h5>
            <p> As our group began prototyping, we first began to create low fidelity wireframes. This enabled as to accurately invision the possible solutions to the development of the Rent Wiz application
