        <p>Inspired by the current rental crisis, Rent Wiz is a potential online rental marketplace, whose goal is to create a fair system of use for both tennants and lardlords.
          This report will discuss and analysis the research, findings, and solutions for the Rent Wiz plateform.
        The following work was completed by Shane, Barry, Emma, and Kelsi from MDDN402 at Victoria University of Wellington.   </p>

              <h3>User Personas</h3>
              <p>The creation of our User Personas 'Mike' and 'Tim' allowed our group to identitfy our core target user groups; Landlords and Tennants.
                During our research process these personas were key to understanding the possible problems and solutions for this platform, and were exceptionally important creating and understanding the user journeys for our user groups.

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>Our group conducted our user testing and research over a one week period. Due to this time constraint, we were only able to interview four individuals; three tennants, and one landlord.
            While our interviews were completed individually, our group was able to create a structured interview plan to insure a fair and consistent interview process.</p>
            <img src="images/testing timeline.png" class="u-max-full-width">
            <img src="images/testingplan.png" class="u-max-full-width">
            <p> Following this plan was easy and effetive in ensuring that our testing was consistent, we all managed to follow and keep the interviews at a steady 35 to 40 minutes long.
              In discussions after completeing our testing, we all agreed that the largest issue was the difficulty of testing Rent Wix's current site and many buttons were broken or lead to incomplete pages.
              Even with this issue, we were still able to identitfy the user's thought and feelings about the concept and proposed purpose of the site, which was extremely valuable.
<hr>
          <h3>Findings </h3>
          <p>Through a mix of user testing and competitor analysis our group was able to develop an understanding of the issues and areas that were in need of attention.
          This section will look at the findings and user journeys associated with this research.</p>
            <h5>User Journeys</h5>
              <p>After conducting our user interviews, and seperating our analysis into two major parts, we were able to create these two user journeys. These journeys follow a tennant and a landload, our two user personas, as they interact with the Rent Wiz platform.
                As the below maps show the largest amount of interaction occurs when the users are signing up, applying for a property, searching for a property, and the communication between the tennants and the landlords. Overall, both users want a clear, concise, and time-saving product.
              </p>

          <img src="images/userjourney2.png" class="u-max-full-width">
            <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
          <p>Our group conducted a competitor analysis task on a series of related, functioning sites and programs.
          These are seperated into two distinct groups; marketplace sites, and landlord management software.
          The platforms that were included in this analysis were; One Roof, TradeMe, Realestate.co.nz, Rent Master, Re-leased, Pocket Rent, My Rent, TenaSee, and Proper.

          <p>
          </p>
            <h5>Analysis of Interviews</h5>
          <p>Using the information gathered during our user testing, our group identitified three core findings from both landlord and tennant user groups.</p>
              <h6>Landlords</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Prioritise simple and open communication between the tenant, landlord, and other involved individuals.</li>
            <li>Control over the tenant selection process to insure an appropriate fit for the properties.</li>
            <li>Focused on streamlining the day-to-day administration and maintenance issues then large occasional task; such as finding new tenants.</li>
          </ul>
            <h6>Tennants</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Tenants become largely frustrated over the competitive rental market, this feeling peaks during January and February.</li>
            <li>Security and trust is a core issue for a tenant when renting, both with property management and property marketplaces.</li>
            <li>Communication problems with property advertisers when attempting to apply, creates annoyance and frustration amongst renters.</li>
          </ul>

<hr>
          <h3>Prototypes</h3>
            <p> After analysing the information we gathered from the competitor analysis and user interviews, we identified four key areas to create and improve upon. These areas were; Landlord Onbaording, Tennant Verification, Tennant Application, and Watchlist management which we divided the tasks amongst ourselves.
              As a group we decided that the best approach to this process was to focus on prototyping for a responsive mobile application.
            We primarily worked on this aspect independently with the occasional comment and help from our team members. </p>

          <h5>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h5>
            <p> As our group began prototyping, we first began to create low fidelity wireframes. This enabled as to accurately invision the possible solutions to the development of the Rent Wiz application
          <h6> Landlord Onboarding </h6>
          <p> This webflow shows the process that occurs after a landlord first signs up for the platform.
            Below details the options that the landlord can take during this stage, as well as giving them the option to authorise a manager.
          </p>
          <img src="images/landlordonboardinglow.png" class="u-max-full-width" style="border:1px solid #73b873" >
          <h6> Tennant Verification </h6>
            <p>The tennant verification presents the process of an already verified tennant going through the stages to verify a new tennant. This process also gives the option to access a FAQ page, as well as to deny the authoisation process.
            </p>
          <img src="images/tennantverificationlow.png" class="u-max-full-width" style="border:1px solid #73b873" >
          <h6> Tennancy Application </h6>
          <p>The below proposed process represents how a tennant would go through appling for a property using the Rent Wiz platform.
            The webflow also shows how the Rent Wiz system deals with application, registering if the tennant meets the landlords requirements, as well as prompting the applying tennant to add other possible tennants/flatmates to the application process.
          </p>
          <img src="images/tennantapplicationlow.png" class="u-max-full-width" style="border:1px solid #73b873" >
          <h6> Watchlists for Searches and Listings </h6>
          <img src="images/watchlistlistinglow.png" class="u-max-full-width " style="border:1px solid #73b873">
          <img src="images/watchlistsearchlow.png" class="u-max-full-width" style="border:1px solid #73b873">

            <h5> General Testing Discoveries </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficult to select text-only buttons</li>
              <li>Confusion between Profile menu and site menu.</li>
            </ul>

          <h5> High Fidelity Wireframes</h5>
            <p>While high fideltity wireframes were created for each of the four stages, this section will only look into those made for the watchlist management protest.
            </p>
            <h6> Watchlist Management for Phones </h6>
            <img src="images/highphone.png" class="u-max-full-width">
            <h6> Watchlist Management for Tablets </h6>
            <img src="images/hightablet.png" class="u-max-full-width">

          <h3>Role Description</h3>
            <h6>Kelsi</h6>
              <p>For this aspect of the project, I aided in the creation of the search and listing watchlist management.
                Within this, I created basic low-fidelity wireframes, user flow diagrams for both search and listings, user testing on a low- fidelity prototype, and iterated to create high fidelity mockups.
